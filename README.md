# zerobnl - examples
*Demonstration of the zerobnl Python package for multi-energy systems distributed co-simulation*


This project provide multiple examples demontrating the use of [zerobnl](https://github.com/IntegrCiTy/zerobnl), a distributed co-simulation tool based on ZeroMQ, Docker (Swarm and Compose) developped in Python.

## Getting Started

The co-simulation examples as well as the creation of the models are done with [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

You can find more about the Jupyter installation [here](http://jupyter.org/install).

Once Jupyter is installed, you need to install [zerobnl](https://github.com/IntegrCiTy/zerobnl) and its requirements following the steps described in the README based on your operating system in the same Python environment where you installed Jupyter.

All the example have to be run in the created Python environment.

You will find more information on the modelling process and the features of the tool [here]()
